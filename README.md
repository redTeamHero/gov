## Supplier Validation & Document Automation

The supply chain module validates supplier eligibility for QPL/QML/source approval requirements and flags critical application items based on RFQ JSON and supplier profiles. The documents module generates deterministic quote and traceability PDFs using rule-based templates and RFQ/supplier/pricing inputs.
